* Move global variables in modules into a state struct that is allocated
in the start function to reduce static memory usage
* Splash screen / restart_reason()
* What should disp library be called?
* in fps mode, keep track of dropped frames and compute running avg of budget
* figure out why onboard LED sometimes on. also blink on error. Need to rewire a rotary? (apparently this LED is driven by gpio48 and uses ws2812 protocol.
implement?)
* Add a function for querying disp_dropped_framecnt. Does the access have
to be protected using the mutex? (I think probably not, as long as the app
is singlethreaded. But verify this)
